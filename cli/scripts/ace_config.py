Table-diff scheduling options
Specify a list of job definitions. Currently, only table-diff and repset-diff
jobs are supported.

A job definition must have the following fields:
- name: The name of the job
- cluster_name: The name of the cluster
- table_name: The name of the table
OR
- repset_name: The name of the repset for repset-diff

If finer control is needed, you could also specify additional arguments in the
args field.
args currently supports the following fields:
- max_cpu_ratio: The maximum number of CPUs to use for the job. Expressed as a
  float between 0 and 1.
- batch_size: The batch size to use for the job. How many blocks does a single
  job process at a time.
- block_size: The maximum number of rows per block. How many rows does a
  single block contain. Each multiprocessing worker running in parallel will
  process this many rows at a time.
- nodes:  A list of node OIDs--if you'd like to run the job only on specific nodes.
- output: The output format to use for the job. Can be "json", "html" or "csv".
- quiet: Whether to suppress output.
- table_filter: A where clause to run table-diff only on a subset of rows. E.g.
  "id < 10000". Note: table_filter argument will be ignored for repset-diff.
- dbname: The database to use.
- skip_tables: A list of tables to skip during repset-diff.


NOTE: For best results, stagger the jobs by at least a few seconds. Do not run
overlapping jobs

Example:
schedule_jobs = [
    {
        "name": "t1",
        "cluster_name": "eqn-t9da",
        "table_name": "public.t1",

ACE Auto-repair Options

Auto-repair is a feature in ACE to automatically repair tables that are
detected to have diverged. Currently, auto-repair supports handling only
insert-insert exceptions. Handling other types of exception will need replication
information from Spock, which it either doesn't track or simply doesn't provide.
The detection happens by polling the spock.exception_status table. However, since
Spock does not automatically insert into the spock.exception_status or the
spock.exception_status_detail tables, ACE has to manually insert into them by
performing a MERGE INTO using all three tables.

How often the exception_status is populated is controlled by the poll_frequency
setting, and how often the repair happens is controlled by the repair_frequency
setting.


To enable auto-repair, set the following options:
- enabled: Whether to enable auto-repair.
- cluster_name: The name of the cluster.
- dbname: The name of the database.
- poll_frequency: The interval at which to poll the exception_log table and
  populate the exception_status and exception_status_detail tables.
- repair_frequency: The interval at which to repair exceptions.

auto_repair_config = {
    "enabled": False,
    "cluster_name": "eqn-t9da",
    "dbname": "demo",
    "poll_frequency": "10m",
    "repair_frequency": "15m",
