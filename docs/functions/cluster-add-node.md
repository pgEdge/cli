## SYNOPSIS
    ./pgedge cluster add-node CLUSTER_NAME SOURCE_NODE TARGET_NODE <flags>

## DESCRIPTION
    Add a new node to a cluster by performing the following steps:

    1. Validate the cluster and target node JSON configurations.
    2. Configure pgBackRest on the source node, if not already configured.
    3. Install pgEdge on the target node, if required.
    4. Restore the target node from a backup of the source node using pgBackRest.
    5. Configure the target node as a standby replica of the source node.
    6. Promote the target node to a primary once it catches up to the source node.
    7. Configure replication and subscriptions for the new node across the cluster.
    8. Reconfigure pgBackrest on the source and target nodes, if required.
    9. Update the cluster JSON configuration with the new node.

    A target node JSON configuration file must be provided in the same directory from which
    this command is invoked, named '<node_name>.json'.
